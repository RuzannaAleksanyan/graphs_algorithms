# Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
## Introduction
This program implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph. The algorithm calculates the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other vertices in the graph.
## Usage
### Compilation
To compile the program, you can use a C++ compiler like `g++`:
## Running the Program
After compiling, you can run the program as follows:
- - ./dijkstra
- The program will prompt you to input the graph's adjacency matrix. Enter the values for each edge in the matrix.
- The program will output the shortest distances from the source vertex to all other vertices in the graph.
## File Structure
- my_dijikstra.h: Header file containing the Dijkstra algorithm implementation.
- test.cpp: Main program that uses the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph.
