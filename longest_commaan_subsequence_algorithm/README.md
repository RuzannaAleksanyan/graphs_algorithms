# Longest Commaan Subsequence Algorithm
## Introduction
This program implements the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm to find the longest common subsequence between two sequences. In this context, the sequences could be strings, arrays, or any ordered collection of elements. The algorithm determines the longest subsequence that appears in the same order in both input sequences.
## Usage:
### In the structure
You can use a C++ compiler such as g++ to compile the program.
## Running the program
After compiling, you can run the program as follows:
- - ./a.out:
- The program will prompt you to enter the array values. Enter the values in the rows.
- The program will output the length of the longest subsequence.
## File structure
- longest_commaan_subsequence_algorithm.h. A header file containing an implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm.
- test.cpp. A basic program that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph.
